# kirsty-dot-website

I'm building this website to teach myself proper semantic markup, CSS, accessibility and anything else that comes up along the way.

I've used 11ty, with Nunjucks as templating engine. Other than that, it's just HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the moment.

Things I'll be looking at in the near future:

-   ~~User toggled dark/light mode~~
-   I hate the blog tags. I need to fix those. Also the blog post list view generally.
-   Keyboard navigation and skip links
-   Image optimisation and best practices
-   Performance
