I'm building this website to teach myself proper semantic markup, CSS, accessibility and anything else that comes up along the way.

I've used 11ty, with Nunjucks as templating engine. Other than that, it's just plain old HTML and CSS for the moment.

Things I'll be looking at in the near future: keyboard navigation and skip links, image optimisation and best practices, performance and writing my first blog.
