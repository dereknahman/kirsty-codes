I'm building this website to teach myself proper semantic markup, CSS, accessibility and anything else that comes up along the way.

I've used 11ty, with Nunjucks as templating engine. Other than that, it's just plain old HTML and CSS for the moment.

It's decidedly unfancy at the moment, and that's how I'll be keeping it. There are plenty of things I've yet to add in, so please treat it as a work in progress for now.
