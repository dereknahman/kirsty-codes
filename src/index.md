I'm a Software Engineer in the Internal Products department at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/). I build tools for journalists and many other types of internal staff members so that they can do their jobs with greater ease and efficiency.

This website is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and I'm using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) as a templating engine. Other than that it's just plain old HTML and CSS.
