I'm a Software Engineer in the Internal Products department at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/). I build tools for journalists and many other types of internal staff members so that they can do their jobs with greater ease and efficiency.

I really love front-end work, but I don't always get a chance to do it. That's most of the reason this blog exists ‚Äî so I can tinker with all these things in my own space, at my own pace. My hope for 2023 is that I can dedicate more time to skilling up on accessibility so that I can fold that knowledge into my everyday work. I'm also a beginner at messing around with [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and seeing if I can make anything cool but so far I've only managed to make a mess.

This website is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and I'm using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) as a templating engine. Other than that it's just plain old HTML and CSS, just the way I like it. But I reserve the right to add something frivolous and unneccessary at some point in future when I've learned how to do so without impacting the user experience.
