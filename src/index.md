I'm Kirsty Simmonds, a Software Engineer at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/). I live in London, where I was born and did most of my growing up.

My main gig is working in the FT's Internal Products department where I help make tools for editorial staff, but I'm currently seconding in the Cyber Security team until November 2024. Prior to becoming a dev in 2019 (with the help of a bootcamp) I had countless other jobs, none of which had anything to do with programming. This means I know a little about a lot and I am always, always kind to the charity muggers you see on the street, albeit while walking past at 100mph.

I am a huge fan of making clothes out of whatever medium is available at the time, especially knitting. I get a lot of satisfaction out of engaging with the technical issues that arise from trying to get a garment to fit a body, learning new techniques for construction and colourwork, and most of all I love the knitting community online which is full of impossibly talented people who are more than happy to chat about their passion for hours with strangers like me.

I have a [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/torahwilcox) profile where I log my knitting projects and bookmark projects I'm interested in making. Feel free to add me as a friend. You will need a profile for yourself to see mine, but it's free to sign up. If that doesn't suit you then no bother. I'll be talking about what I make a lot on my blog anyway.
