I'm Kirsty Simmonds, a Software Engineer at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/). I live in London, where I was born and did most of my growing up.

My main gig is working in the FT's Internal Products department where I help make tools for editorial staff, but I'm currently seconding in the Cyber Security team until November 2024. Prior to becoming a dev in 2019 (with the help of a bootcamp) I had countless other jobs, none of which had anything to do with programming. This means I know a little about a lot and I am always, always kind to the charity muggers you see on the street, albeit while walking past at 100mph.

I am a huge fan of making clothes out of whatever medium is available at the time, especially knitting. I get a lot of satisfaction out of engaging with the technical issues that arise from trying to get a garment to fit a body, learning new techniques for construction and colourwork, and most of all I love the knitting community online which is full of impossibly talented people who are more than happy to chat about their passion for hours with strangers like me.

If you're into crafting too, I have a [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/torahwilcox) profile where I log my projects and favourite projects I'm interested in, feel free to add me as a friend. You will need a profile for yourself to see mine, but it's free to sign up. If that doesn't suit you then no bother, I'll be talking about what I make a lot on my blog anyway.

### About this site

This website is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a very convenient and powerful static site generator, and I'm using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) as a templating engine. Other than that it's just HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript.

The fonts I've chosen, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee), are available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I deploy using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is somehow free and handles HTTPS for me. I trigger deploys by pushing my code to a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo.
