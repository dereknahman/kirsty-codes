    summary:
        "Hello, I'm Kirsty. This is a blog I'm throwing together to teach myself
        proper HTML, CSS and accessibility. It's very rudimentary for now but
        I'm working on it!"

This website is built using 11ty, and I'm using Nunjucks as a templating engine. Other than that it's just plain old HTML and CSS.

I be keeping the engineering very light (it is, after all, just a wee blog) but I'm aiming for WCAG AA compliance as a minimum, and I'll be using this website as an opportunity to dive into accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS, PWAs and maybe a touch of JavaScript if I'm feeling fruity.

It's by no means finished, but I'll be picking away at it over the next few months when I have little bursts of coding energy outside of work.
