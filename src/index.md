I'm Kirsty Simmonds, a Software Engineer at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/). I live in London, where I was born and did most of my growing up.

I work in the FT's Internal Products department where I help to make tools for editorial staff, but I'll be seconding with the Cyber Security team until November 2024. Prior to becoming a dev in 2019 (with the help of a bootcamp) I had countless other jobs, none of which had anything to do with programming. This means I know a little about a lot and I am always, always kind to the charity muggers you see on the street, albeit while walking past at 100mph.

My hands are _extremely_ busy and I'm always making something, ususally several things at once. Some of the time this means knitting and some of the time it means programming. [Fair isle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Isle_(technique)>) knitting is my true love, but I'm interested in all the ways you can make clothes out of two sticks and plan to try them all. As for programming, the front-end is where my heart is, but I enjoy roaming around too.

I have a [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/torahwilcox) profile where I log my knitting projects and bookmark patterns I'm interested in making. Feel free to add me as a friend. You will need a profile to see mine, but it's free to sign up. If that doesn't suit you then no bother. I'll be talking about what I make a lot on my blog anyway.
