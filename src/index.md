This website is built using 11ty, and I'm using Nunjucks as a templating engine. Other than that it's just plain old HTML and CSS, just the way I like it. But I reserve the right to add something frivolous and unneccessary at some point in future when I've learned how to do so without impacting the user experience.

Consider this thing a work in progress. I'm prone to huge bursts of coding energy outside of work followed by periods of being completely fascinated with building things by other means in the real world, so this will get neglected from time-to-time. Yes, I built a blog feed. No, I haven't written any blogs yet. And that's just fine.
