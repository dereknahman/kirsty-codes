This website is built using 11ty, and I'm using Nunjucks as a templating engine. Other than that it's just plain old HTML and CSS.

I'll be keeping the engineering very light (it is, after all, just a wee blog) but I'm aiming for WCAG AA compliance as a minimum, and I'll be using this website as an opportunity to dive into accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS, PWAs and maybe a touch of JavaScript if I'm feeling fruity.

It's by no means finished, but I'll be picking away at it over the next few months when I have little bursts of coding energy outside of work.
