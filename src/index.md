        "Hello, I'm Kirsty. This is a blog I'm throwing together to teach myself
        proper HTML, CSS and accessibility. It's very rudimentary for now but
        I'm working on it!"

This website is built using 11ty. I'm using Nunjucks as a templating engine. I hope to keep the engineering very light (it is, after all, just a blog) but I'm aiming for WCAG AA compliance as a minimum, and I'll be using this website as an opportunity to dive into accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS, PWAs and maybe a touch of JavaScript if I'm feeling fruity.
