Hello friends! Nice to have you here.

### Work

At the end of 2023 I went for an internal job I didn't think I would get and got it. I'm the newest Cyber Security Engineer at the FT!

It's been fun to get to grapple with new technical problems but the old imposter syndrome has been nipping my heels on occasion (although is that even the right concept to mention since I genuinely do not know a lot about cyber?!). New tools, new programming languages, new people, new schedule. I've been using and learning Python and Terraform for a lot of this month and it's been mostly interesting and occasionally frustrating.

This job is a pretty big step outside of my comfort zone and I hope I can squeeze as much information into my head as possible to take back to my old team at the end of the year. I've been a little self-conscious about how much time it's taking me to complete tickets on this team compared to my old team, but absolutely nobody is putting any pressure on me in that regard. That's a little treat from me to me.

The most interesting technical thing I learned how to do this month was using [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), namely writing subparsers and testing them with PyTest.

### Life

I've been thinking about some things I want to change about myself this coming year. If I manage to take care of myself and others better than in 2023 I'll be perfectly happy with that, but there is one thing that I am interested in zoning in on.

I have a tendency to sign up to things I think will be fun or interesting and then get overwhelmed on arrival and back out abruptly, usually due to reaching a point of overwhelm about the socialising side of things. Apparently this is very common with autistic people, especially women, and as much as I struggle with that label (it was confidently handed to me by an expert a year ago, but I have mixed feelings about it) I fit neatly into that trope. It isn't something I like about myself, but it is a part of me.

Sometimes I do manage to make things stick though, and it has led to a lot of positive things (a new career, lots of genuinely incredible friends when I moved abroad after about 10 seconds of thinking it through, a cute mushroom tattoo, a fiance), but also a lot of stress. I'd like to pace myself a little better from now on, and try to resist the urge to withdraw when it hits, at least some of the time. I've got plans to start small and re-enter some community spaces I wigged out and ran away from in 2023. I'll hopefully have more to say about that next time I write one of these. A possible outcome of this is that I fail and realise group settings are just not for me, and that would be ok, but I would like to try some more things before I come to that conclusion.

I've signed up to a [Learn to Leyn](https://www.yeshiva.lgbt/leyn) course which is going to be wonderful experience, and will help me with my plans to be more present around other people.

### Making

Every hour or so minutes I Google "rigid heddle loom" and stare at [the one I've chosen for myself](https://www.weftblown.com/products/flip-rigid-heddle-loom), but I just cannot comfortably fit that thing in our flat. I want it _intensely_. I've mapped out [the course I'd take to learn how to use it](https://www.steek.scot/product/beginners-weaving-class/), [the projects I'd make to get started](https://www.steek.scot/product/weaving-design-plans/), and I know if I buy it my life will become about weaving for months and I won't be able to engage with many other things I need to keep up with, hence I'm just Googling and dreaming for now. If you have a loom and we're friends PLEASE invite me round for a tea and a quick go at it. I have many many questions.

In the mean time I'll make do with knitting which is only the thing I most enjoy doing in the whole world. This past month I planned a totally bespoke jumper for my partner's upcoming 40th using some tips from [Barbara G. Walker's Knitting from the Top](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780942018097/Knitting-Top-Barbara-G-Walker-0942018095/plp) â€” my first time writing my own pattern. I won't grade and release it because that doesn't interest me in the least and I don't think it would be that useful to anyone since it's shaped around a very long and narrow man. It will not be ready for his 40th, but that's probably for the best as a lot of us will be going for [a succulent Chinese meal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XebF2cgmFmU) and I'll have a psychological breakdown if it gets stained. [The yarn he chose](https://www.jarbon.com/product/yarnadelic-worsted/) is a beautiful quality and the colour is like nothing I've ever seen. It looks like Starlings.

A rough list of things I'm currently working on: very labour intensive aran weight all-over cable cardigan I've been hacking at since 2022, a pig, a Shetland wool jumper with a Fair Isle yoke, I've got a second Fair Isle glove that needs doing, I need to finish some alpaca mitts, there's a half-finished crochet English Sheepdog somewhere...that genuinely isn't even all of the things I've got hanging around the flat. I actually enjoy living like this but inevitably progress in the form of completed projects is slow.

The [wool](https://knittingforolive.com/collections/knitting-for-olives-merino/products/knitting-for-olive-merino-cream) (and [mohair](https://knittingforolive.com/collections/knitting-for-olive-soft-silk-mohair/products/knitting-for-olive-soft-silk-mohair-snowflake)) arrived for my wedding project. The dress has been secured and it's genuinely the most beautiful and perfect dress of all dresses, but it might get nippy in the evening. I've chosen [quite a vintage-feeling, cropped cardigan](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/faerie-dreams) with a not-overwhelming amount of lace detailing to make with cream wool and bright white mohair. I'm taking all but the two vertical lace panels out of it, and I'll also get rid of all the cables and adjust the fit if need be, but I hope need doesn't be.

At the very end of the month I finished a lovely donkey called Horacio, [pattern here](https://daughterofashepherd.com/products/mouche-friends-by-cinthia-vallet), complete with dungos and a hat, for a friend of my partner who has some good plans for him. Of all the things I make, people respond best to the knitted animals. It's sweet watching adults transform into their younger selves at the sight of a tiny bear in a cable jumper, or a donkey in dungarees.

### Listening

[This episode of This is Love](https://thisislovepodcast.com/episode-75-here-i-am) is gorgeous. It's about a couple having their second Bat/Bar Mitzvahs in their 80s. It's from a while back but I went back to it on a Shabbos morning recently and it healed a little bit of me that has felt quite disconnected from Jewish culture lately.

Speaking of going back to old things, NTS reminded me about Connie Converse this month. She wrote the most perfect, funniest, most devastating songs. I love [Father Neptune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhz0b93tzzQ&ab_channel=ConnieConverse-Topic) and [Playboy of the Western World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvzZSQ_is1Q&ab_channel=ConnieConverse-Topic).

### Reading

The thing I read most of this month are the docs for Python, Pytest and Terraform. Thrilling!

I've been finishing [the Chernobyl book](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/09/chernobyl-history-tragedy-serhii-plokhy-review-disaster-europe-soviet-system) this month which is as you would expect it to be. Very well told and utterly devastating. I didn't know that, if the other reactors would have blown, it would have been the end of all breathing life on Earth. I will have another go at watching the series. I couldn't really get over the incongruous accents last time I tried but I know I'm being a prat.

I've been happily diving into two quite legendary books on Fair Isle knitting from [Ann Feitelson](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-art-of-fair-isle-knitting/ann-feitelson/9781596681385) and [Sheila McGregor](https://www.doverbooks.co.uk/traditional-fair-isle-knitting). I'd recommend both for patterns, charts and the social history of the craft. Feitelson's book also advises on how to use mathematics to your advantage when desigining your own fair isle garments which I plan to use when I'm brave enough to tackle my own one day.
