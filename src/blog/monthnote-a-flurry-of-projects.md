### Life

Hello friends, nice to have you here.

2024 has been kind to me so far, albeit overwhelming in places with all the changes that have been happening and will happen soon that I'll explain below. I've naturally been thinking about some things I want to change about myself this coming year. If I manage to take care of myself and others better than in 2023, I'll be happy with it. There is one thing above all other things that I would like to change though.

I have a tendency to sign up to things I think will be fun/interesting/a gateway to knowledge and then get overwhelmed on arrival and, in a lot of cases, back out abruptly, usually due to reaching a point of overwhelm about the social relationship side of things. Apparently this is very common with autistic people, especially women, and as much as I struggle with that label (it was confidently handed to me by an expert a year ago, but I do not feel at home in it) I fit neatly into that trope. It isn't something I like about myself, but it is something I do.

Sometimes I do manage to make things stick though, and it has led to a lot of positive things (a new career, lots of genuinely incredible friends when I moved abroad after about 10seconds of thinking it through, a cute mushroom tattoo, a fiance), but also a lot of stress. I'd like to pace myself a little better from now on, and try to resist the urge to withdraw when it hits. I've got plans to start small and re-enter some community spaces I wigged out and ran away from in 2023. I'll hopefully have more to say about that next time I write one of these.

I've signed up to a [Learn to Leyn](https://www.yeshiva.lgbt/leyn) course which is going to be wonderful, and will help me with my plans to be more present around other people.

### Work

At the end of 2023 I went for an internal job I didn't think I would get and got it. I'm the newest Cyber Security Engineer at the FT! It's been quite overwhelming because I struggle with change and there has been a lot of it. New tools, new programming languages, new people, new schedule. I've been grappling with Python and Terraform for a lot of this month and it's been mostly interesting and occasionally frustrating. Soon I'll know more about what I'm doing, or so I tell myself.

### Making

Every 20 or so minutes I Google "rigid heddle loom" and stare at [the one I've chosen for myself](https://www.weftblown.com/products/flip-rigid-heddle-loom), but I just cannot comfortably fit it in our flat (I think?!). I want it _intensely_.

In the mean time I'll make do with knitting which is only the thing I most enjoy doing in the whole world. This past month I planned a totally bespoke jumper for my partner's upcoming 40th â€” my first time writing my own pattern. I won't grade and release it because that doesn't interest me in the least. It will not be ready for his 40th, but that's probably for the best as a lot of us will be going for a succulent Chinese meal and I'll have a breakdown if it gets stained. [The yarn he chose](https://www.jarbon.com/product/yarnadelic-worsted/) is beautiful and looks like Starlings.

A rough list of things I'm currently working on: very labour intensive aran weight all-over cable cardigan I've been hacking at since 2022, a pig, a Shetland wool jumper with a Fair Isle yoke, I've got a second Fair Isle glove that needs doing, I need to finish some alpaca mitts, there's a half-finished crochet English Sheepdog somewhere...that genuinely isn't even all of the things I've got hanging around the flat. I actually enjoy living like this but inevitably progress in the form of completed projects is slow.

The wool arrived for my wedding project. The dress has been secured and it's genuinely the most beautiful and perfect dress of all dresses, but it might get nippy in the evening. I've chosen [quite a vintage-feeling, cropped cardigan](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/faerie-dreams) with a not-overwhelming amount of lace detailing to make with cream wool and bright white mohair. I'm taking all but the two vertical lace panels out of it, and I'll also get rid of all the cables and adjust the fit if need be, but I hope need doesn't be.

I did finish a lovely donkey called Horacio, [pattern here](https://daughterofashepherd.com/products/mouche-friends-by-cinthia-vallet), complete with dungos and a hat, for a friend of my partner who has some good plans for him. Of all the things I make, people respond best to the knitted animals. It's sweet watching adults transform into their younger selves at the sight of a tiny bear in a cable jumper, or a donkey in dungarees.

### Listening

[This episode of This is Love](https://thisislovepodcast.com/episode-75-here-i-am) is gorgeous. It's about a couple having their second Bat/Bar Mitzvahs in their 80s. It's from a while back but I went back to it on a Shabbos morning recently and it healed a little bit of me that has felt quite disconnected from Jewish culture lately.

Speaking of going back to old things, NTS reminded me about Connie Converse this month. She wrote the most perfect, funniest, most devastating songs. I love [Father Neptune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhz0b93tzzQ&ab_channel=ConnieConverse-Topic) and [Playboy of the Western World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvzZSQ_is1Q&ab_channel=ConnieConverse-Topic).

### Reading

The thing I read most of this month are the docs for Python, Pytest and Terraform. Thrilling!

I've been finishing [the Chernobyl book](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/09/chernobyl-history-tragedy-serhii-plokhy-review-disaster-europe-soviet-system) this month which is as you would expect it to be. Very well told and utterly devastating. I didn't know that, if the other reactors would have blown, it would have been the end of all breathing life on Earth. I will have another go at watching the series. I couldn't really get over the incongruous accents last time I tried but I know I'm being a prat.

I've been happily diving into two quite legendary books on Fair Isle knitting from [Ann Feitelson](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-art-of-fair-isle-knitting/ann-feitelson/9781596681385) and [Sheila McGregor](https://www.doverbooks.co.uk/traditional-fair-isle-knitting). I'd recommend both for patterns, charts and the social history of the craft. Feitelson's book also advises on how to use mathematics to your advantage when desigining your own fair isle garments which I plan to use when I'm brave enough to tackle my own one day.
