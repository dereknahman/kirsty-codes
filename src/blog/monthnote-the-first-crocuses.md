Flowers I've spotted this week: crocuses, daffodils, narcissus, snowdrops. It is SPRING and I am READY.

### Work

I had quite a unique experience this month. I ran a "post mortem" meeting, which probably wasn't the right name for the meeting since the system we were discussing was not dead, but we did make plans to decommission it during said meeting. What's the right Agile term for that? Anyway, that's what happened. An internal tool we'd built a fair while ago to collate software vulnerabilities was not embraced with open arms for a variety of reasons and we will soon turn it off and hopefully replace it with a system that actually does solve this problem.

A new person will join the team that I am also quite new to next week. I've been doing some thinking about how to make their time enjoyable and help them to feel supported while not falling into a traditional management role which I am trying to avoid for the moment. People say I would be good at management but I think they mean "you are friendly and organised" and not "you have what it takes to make potentially very tough decisions about someone else's work life" which is what the role means to me. I wrote up some criteria for being a buddy, and I have assigned myself their buddy (presumptuous but effective). [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7mknSsNy8OAi7Apv82aim4u-mCEYqkTy24suqZryiQ/edit) are the criteria, maybe you'd like to use them on your teams too.

### Life

I had my first mock driving test in February. Absolutely disgraced myself, but, according to my driving instructor, not as badly as most people do this early in the process. I've got an Actual Test Date in late July which according to him is too late but there are all sorts of boring and catastrophic things happening with driving tests in the UK atm and this is the best I can hope for without handing a load of cash to a black market test dealer (yes, really). I'll be quite sad to come to the end of my time with B, my instructor. I've learned a lot about driving, but also what his kids are up to, where Keir Starmer lives, what Jeremy Corbyn is like irl, and the vast array of beautiful trees that grow in Bangladesh. Here's a picture of one he told me about, the [Krishna Chura](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/531928573/photo/royal-poinciana.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=FDDmtQzHB8-kuaxpc0xWiQMLnF8fdvUL13Rn0tGL9Ag=). I told him about [mimosas](https://horticulture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimosa-header.jpg) in exchange, he seemed really into them.

After 18 months of very loyal attendance I left my yoga studio and took up [F45](https://f45training.com/) instead. Characteristically this decision took very little forethought, I just changed what had been a very stable routine on a whim. I'm enjoying it though and I think it's much better that I get to expend my energy quickly and vigorously and get to feel a bit sore afterwards. It feels more in line with who I am. I am not a very serene kind of woman.

My partner turned 40 this month and my wee niece turned one. It was a pleasure making a fuss of them both.

### Making

There's been a bit of a making drought on as I'm still diligently working through my first self-drafted jumper. I've executed the shoulder shaping and about 99% of the body. It'll be done in March and if J let's me I'll post a photo of it with him in it so you can see the shaping better, because I'm quite proud of that bit.

I did cast on my wedding project. A cursory Google search tells me that our wedding date has seen reliably good weather for the past five years, so this project may be totally unnecessary, but I fancied knitting something for the day. I chose the [Yorlin by Kate Davies](https://www.shopkdd.com/yorlin-kit), whose work I've been interested in for a long while. I'm doing mine in a strand of ice-white silk mohair and a strand of a pale cream merino. There isn't much of it yet.

### Listening

I listened to two excellent podcast episodes this month. [This episode of You're Wrong About on the shoe bomber](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6QVGwSUmBu0WRCxTH6reLm?si=ad839c3db86c4b97) is the first I'll mention. I was too young to grasp all the intricacies of what was going on at the time but I do remember seeing him in the paper. The story behind the bomber himself is desperately sad.

[This episode of Bad Gays on Ahebi Ugbabe](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6k2DFqIXE6oWRy1WHhzwN3?si=7de684133df94803) was a fascinating story that brought in sex, gender, politics and power in early 19thC Nigeria, a place I know shamefully little about.

### Reading

Patrick Radeen Keefe, author of Empire of Pain and Say Nothing (strong recommend for both), [wrote about Zac Brettler's disapperance for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/02/12/a-teens-fatal-plunge-into-the-london-underworld). I am glad I read it, though it left a bit of a hole in my chest. I did not read any novels this month and I want to change this in March.

Chat to you then.
