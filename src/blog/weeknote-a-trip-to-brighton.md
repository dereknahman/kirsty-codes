I'm going to have a go at weeknotes for a bit since I find it impossible to remember what I did more than three days ago, making me a bad candidate for the monthnote format.

-   J and I went to the Chanel exhibition at the V&A. I had a life-alteringly amazing experience at the McQueen equivalent a decade ago and was hoping for something similar. Alas it was very dull. We had a nice time chatting on the bus home. That was the best bit. She didn't seem remotely interested in genuine feeling so I couldn't be bothered.

-   I went to the wonderful [Patterns Day](https://patternsday.com/) on Thursday. My pal Fred from Berlin was going, and I really wanted to get down there and catch up with him. I had a wonderful time and successfully fought off some mild mid-day horror that was trying to put me on the train back home. Fred had arranged to meet a another friend of his in the evening who it turned out I also know from a groupchat, so we all joined up and put in a pretty great performance at the pub quiz (joint third place, honk honk). The whole day made me want to work on design systems and move to Brighton (suggestible).

-   Plans for our wedding are gently ballooning, but I think that's coming to an end now. I've hired a hair and make-up artist to get me ready for the day because my hands shake when I'm anxious and there is no way I can be trusted with my own face in that state. She's extremely lovely, [you should hire her too](https://glamtam.co.uk/). J and I are handing out RSPB badges as wedding favours and he has spent quite a few hours diligently matching our guests to their animal equivalents. I chose an emerald moth because I like moths, the colour green, emeralds, and Dungeness. J chose a mackerel which is hugely incompatible with my choice, but we won't read too much into that.

-   Many happy hours were spent working out how to add [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to this site. There is more to do (cron job to fetch new mentions a couple of times per day, generally refactoring and tidying up, learning how caching works after MacGuyvering a load of code together, sending Webmentions, probably other things) but they're working OK for now. I'll go into more detail about the resources I used to get them working in the Extras section of my site some time this coming week.

-   We finished Better Call Saul. Amazing. Now we've started [King of the Hill](https://archive.org/details/king-of-the-hill13seasons/King+of+the+Hill+S01E01+Pilot.mp4). Also amazing. Predictably I like the one where Bobby meets his Jewish step-grandfather the best. Also enjoyed that Hank has a tiny can of WD40 to unstick the cap of his larger can of WD40.

-   I finished my wedding website! Would anyone be interested in me putting together a repo and docs for it? It's a simple page and a form with Google Sheets in the backend, password-protected via Netlify (for a fee). Very, very low-fi but responsive and does the job. If even one person is interested I'll throw together a starter repo in the next week or so.

### Listening

-   I woke up with [I'm an Amendment to Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSANTRnEBgg&t=1s) in my head on Wesnesday. It followed me for the rest of the week. A lot of it went over my head as a kid but _bangs on about how few things ever change in politics_.

### Reading

-   Picked up [Hilary Mantel's Beyond Black](https://booksellercrow.co.uk/shop/beyond-black/) again. I had a false start with it a while back but I'm loving it now. Alison is a really unique character.

### Watching

-   I promised myself I would post things on this blog even I was convinced no one would give a shit about them but me. In that spirit, [here's a link to a lovely German-language (but English-subtitled) documentary on the history of knitting in Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2G47X3XK4U&t=63s).
