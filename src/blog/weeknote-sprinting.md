-   I led my first sprint planning this past week. I don't think we're going to finish all the tickets in time. I will hopefully get better at this over time...

-   My manager James did some very inspirational managing of me this week. Having a manager that will not only meet your needs but do so enthusiastically is a rare and precious thing and if you're reading this James - thank you!

-   I did another mock driving test. This was my worst one yet. I was feeling pretty brain-fried from the day. I started the test with the handbrake on and drove for far too long before I noticed. The real test is at the end of July and I'm hopeful I will have conquered my fear of roundabouts by then.

-   I realised I need to have a side-project to keep my programming skills alive during this 11-month stint as a Cyber engineer who doesn't really code. Building things was one of the great pleasures of my job and I miss it! I'm going to do some noodling around with API design in Node one afternoon a week.

-   My podcast recommendation for this week is [this new-to-me episode of A Bit Fruity in which the presenter interviews the woman who invented the gender reveal party (and regrets it)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2n5MebMid1FlDGm3DIfTER?si=b57393d89e754ac1). She is a sweet person and comes across surprisingly wonderfully. She's much more clued up on revolutionary queer politics than you'd think.
