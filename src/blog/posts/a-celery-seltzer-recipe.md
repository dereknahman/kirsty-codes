### Ingredients

-   1Â½ tablespoons of celery seeds
-   200g white sugar
-   Sparkling water
-   Ice

Grind the seeds in a pestle and mortar until coarse.

In a saucepan mix the seeds, sugar and 240ml of water and bring to a boil over a gentle heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved and it's a little thicker in texture. This will take around five minutes.

Take the pan off the heat and leave for 1-2 hours. Strain through a fine mesh into a jar or whatever receptacle you have handy.

Add 1-2 teaspoons of this mixture to a glass with sparkling water and ice to serve.
