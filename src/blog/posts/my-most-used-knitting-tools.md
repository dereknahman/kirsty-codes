I'm going to list the knitting kit that I use most often in this post. I'm lucky in that I have lots of lovely things, but only a sub-set of that is what you'd call essential. I just adore collecting gear.

### Needles

I learned how to knit with the [Addi Click Basic interchangeable needles](https://www.woolstack.co.uk/addi-click-basic-interchangeable-circular-knitting-needle-set/). I would still be using them now if I didn't upgrade to some Chiaogoo interchangeables after my first bonus, but doing so is in no way essential. They're metal (nickel-free for my fellow nickel-allergy-ridden friends out there) and come with a set of cables of varying lengths and some small tools, including stitch markers.

Soon after buying the Addi Basics I noticed they were too long for me to knit a hat in the round. I bought [this shorter set](https://www.woolstack.co.uk/addi-click-lace-interchangeable-circular-knitting-needle-set/) to combat that problem a few months later. With those two sets I was able to knit pretty much anything other than fine lace, and I could have had a happy knitting career with them forever if I wasn't deeply into refining my tools until they're perfect.

Now I use this [Chiaogoo interchangeable set](https://www.thelittleknittingcompany.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1897) and [this Seeknit set](https://www.amibari.jp/english/project/premium-10cm-set-11sizes-id-59733), as well as an array of double pointed needles of various lengths and materials that I keep in a jute roll holder. I adore them both and find them both useful depending on the yarn I'm knitting with. Pure silk requires metal needles (in my opinion, anyway) whereas cashmere benefits from bamboo and the increased grip it offers.

### Notions

Stich markers are non-negotiable, but the nice thing is you don't actually have to buy the fancy ones. A small length of waste wool tied in a loop works wonders. If you want something a bit sturdier than that, I like [these loops](https://www.yarnworx.com/products/cocoknits-small-coloured-ring-stitch-markers?variant=32245908930695&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&srsltid=AfmBOoo0GF0PHIoUfo-RBSDJdLY4TWsh40RDZtpoRF_3k2zJ_Er2vBln-Zo) and these [bulb pins](https://merchantandmills.com/uk/coppered-bulb-pins). If you can only afford one type, get the bulb pins.

You'll need a darning needle to sew your ends in on the wrong side of your projects. [I like these](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/166088726748?var=465595035501).

Other things you'll need: [tape measure](https://www.wildandwoollyshop.co.uk/shop/accessories/tools/tape-measures/rollfix-retractable-tape-measure/), [row counter](https://www.wildandwoollyshop.co.uk/shop/accessories/tools/other-bits-bobs/row-counter-2/), something you like to take notes in, waste yarn (I use [this](https://www.lovecrafts.com/en-gb/p/paintbox-yarns-cotton-dk) from my amigurumi days because it's strong, but you should use any you have lying around).

Obviously you'll need somewhere to put all these things. I store my knitting gear in [these baskets](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1612728796/50-colors-small-collapsible-stackable?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=stacking+baskets&ref=sc_gallery-1-6&pro=1&plkey=f26dc2ec2731de7cb1186db6f455511eb43471b7%3A1612728796), stacked up. My smaller notions [go in one of these](https://www.modulor.de/en/zipper-bag-transparent-with-4-compartments.html), which I ADORE and I regret not buying a spare when I was in Berlin last winter.

### And that's it!

I hoped this helped someone out there. I'll post about my not-exactly-essential-but-still-wonderful kit another time.
