Content warning: This weeknote is partly about exercise, with some mentions of recipes I've been enjoying. If that isn't for you, neither is this post. Check back another time when I'm hopefully more exciting ✌🏻.

-   [I've started weightlifting regularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MfzHsBDh-4). I went three times in a row this week and my body feels pretty sore. I'm really happy at [F45](https://f45training.com/) and even happier I can go on the basis of quite a good deal provided by my employer via Gympass. On days I don't go there I'm going to start building up my astanga practice again because I've really missed it and want to maintain my flexibility. I've noticed I'm pretty good at the F45 exercises that rely on good balance, and I credit the past two years of regular yoga practice with that. Those exercises make up for the box jumps. I am not talented at box jumps. I can't quite get the image of my shins snapping off the side of the box out of my head when I do them?

-   Trying to build my JavaScript physique has involved looking at what I'm eating, particularly how much protein I'm eating (very little, it turns out). [This powder is quite delicious](https://theorganicproteincompany.co.uk/products/organic-whey-protein-madagascan-vanilla), which you cannot say about most of them.

-   We're pretty set on going to Thailand for our honeymoon later this year. I am wide open for recommendations for where to go and what to do in Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Phi Phi, Krabi, and anywhere else you think is worthwhile please! I've watched quite a few YouTube videos now and they all mention how unethical elephant sanctuaries are, and also list an elephant sanctuary they liked that "doesn't cater to tourists". This doesn't make sense to me on the surface. If you know of ethical ways I could get near an elephant please do share those, but if it's impossible I'd rather not engage with any of it. My idea of a good far-away holiday is good food, drink, walking, snorkelling opportunities and making pals with at least one animal I probably shouldn't be touching for health reasons (I miss you, tribe of Greek cats I loved in 2022).

-   I had another mock driving test. My instructor can't get his head around the fact that I'm able to navigate roundabouts successfully but I fumble immediately after or immediately before. I can't either. He has recommended beta blockers to me about seven times now, hint taken.

-   My hunt for a small wedding veil is uncovering some [truly odd shit](https://eugeniakim.com/products/cookie?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=53b498658&pr_rec_pid=8193450049791&pr_ref_pid=8125801890047&pr_seq=uniform).

-   Irina has come to town!!! Soon after writing this I'll be heading out to meet her and we'll do a classic north London circuit (heath -> Spaniard's Inn, hmm that's more of a line rather than a circuit, but you understand). The trick with the Spaniard's is to not drink so much that you immediately die trying to navigate that impossible bend in the road on the way out.

### Watching

-   I'm not usually a huge one for standup comedy (despite going to a Simon Munnery show just this month which I really enjoyed), so I'm surprised I clicked on this but so glad I did. [Autistic comedian Pierre Novellie speaks about how he was diagnosed by a heckler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1jLTT4Ti-E&t=4362s), and why stand-up is in some ways the idea career for autistic (no complex conversational back and forth! you can be rude if people interrupt you! you can rehearse everything!). There was a lot of stuff in there that really resonated with me.

### Reading

-   My copy of [Shetland Lace Knitting by Carol Christiansen](https://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/shetland-fine-lace-knitting-recreating-patterns-from-the-past/carol-christiansen/hardback/9780719842870.html) arrived this week. The author, who manages the knitted collection at the Shetland Museum, has collected recreated patterns from the Shetland Museum archives. It's an extremely important contribution to the living history of the craft and I can't wait to dig in on Sunday.

Have a lovely weekend everyone.
