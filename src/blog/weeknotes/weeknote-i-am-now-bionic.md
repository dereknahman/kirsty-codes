This past week went by in a big rush.

-   I'm getting used to nexplanon, aka the contraceptive implant. I got it to deal with heavy (12+ day) periods. It has brought with it an almost immediate, lengthy period. Lots of reaping what I've sown going on here. There's a good chance it will help me in the long term but there's a bedding-in process that makes everything worse before it gets better. If I were a pharmacist I would concoct medicines that do not do that x

-   I went on a friend date having been set up by I all the way from Denmark. It was lovely. I also bumped into D on the way out of the pub who needed help with "drinking excess pints" which was a difficult offer to walk away from but, due to the above, I'm also pretty knackered at the mo.

-   Our hot water and heating are fixed. I told myself I'd never take them for granted again but I was strutting around the house in shorts with the heating whacked up to 28C within a day.

-   I'm really enjoying Erasure by Percival Everett.

-   My pal L has turned me into a Hobonichi Techo person. Sometimes I get it out just to stare at it.

-   I ordered an iPad because reading knitting patterns on a laptop grinds my gears.
