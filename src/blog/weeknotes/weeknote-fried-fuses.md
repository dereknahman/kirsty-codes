-   My driving instructor, B, tells me I am ready for my test now. We went to do some real parking in an Asda car park (rather than the babysteps parking we'd been doing in random empty car parks across Hendon) and I managed to get in and out of the space using a variety of methods without hitting anything. My test isn't until the end of July though. He has told me I should pass first time, which is no pressure at all ü•≤

-   On Friday night the fuse box blew up. The oven isn't working and there is no heating or hot water. I am logging onto Google Meet calls swathed in blankets. Hopefully a fix will be underway soon, and as is the way with these things it's looking to be more expensive a fix than we had originally anticipated.

-   I began a new jumper. Nobody needs a new knitting project less than I do, but I had some gorgeous DK weight yarn burning a hole in my pocket and [PetiteKnit's Esther Sweater](https://www.petiteknit.com/en/products/esther-sweater) is the ideal candidate for it. What I _should_ be doing is finishing [my partner's custom jumper](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/torahwilcox/starling-sweater) which is in want of sleeves, but working up the momentum for sleeves is its own thing entirely. And I have [my wedding project](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/torahwilcox/yorlin) to finish! Why do I do this? I will continue to do this.

-   I went for a lovely coffee with my friend Lydia on Saturday. We sat in high winds outside the National Theatre cafe doing about four years worth of catching up. I lent her my copy of [Sarah Hendrickx's book](https://lighthousebookshop.com/book/9781849055475) and she invited me to come and see her play as part of an orchestra next week which I am _really_ excited about. She plays the clarinet and tells me there will be Bart√≥k. I love a bit of clarinet and I really love Bart√≥k.

-   On Sunday night I watched [It Follows](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/) with J. Jesus Christ it was frightening. At the beginning of winter I sat through the entirety of Texas Chainsaw Massacre with no problems whatsoever but an unknown entity loping slowly towards you on foot? Fuck that. Great film though.
