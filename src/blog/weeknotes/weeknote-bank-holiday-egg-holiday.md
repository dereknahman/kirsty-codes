-   I missed a week of weeknotes because I spent five days writhing in pain on the sofa with a wee cold to boot. I feel better now and am going to try and find a solution to my heavy periods that doesn't involve changing shape rapidly, horrible psychological upheavals or just feeling really tired. A small rod will be going in my arm on Thursday. It might fix everything or it might make everything worse, such is the way with these things. Wish us luck.

-   The most recent week was nicer. The abdominal pain went away and the cold did too. I went to a lot of reformer pilates classes, strength training classes and a took a few trips to an infrared sauna.

-   J and I went to [Little Georgia](https://littlegeorgia.co.uk/) for the first time. That was BRILLIANT since I finally got to eat [khachapuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khachapuri), though there was a minor heartbreak moment when the waiter let us know my light and zingy main course wasn't available, but I could have the chicken instead, and I said OK, and then it came out sitting on top of a lake of cream and butter and garlic. Hnnnggghhhhfffffffff.

-   I went to D's house to hang out and eat Trini mutton curry. We scattered Lenu's ashes under a tree. I met up with Kimchi for the first time in years and she is somehow still the smallest adult cat on Earth. It felt really good to catch up with some old friends. During this visit I was introduced to [Tajin](https://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/brands/tajin/tajin-chilli-and-lime-seasoning-142g) which I will be thinking about for every waking moment until I can score my own bottle.

-   I am test knitting [Annabel Williams](https://annabelwilliams.co.uk/)' latest design, the Meadow Scarf. I chose the wrong yarn for the job so it's a very rigid scarf rather than [the lovely, drapey one in her photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4xvdQFolGN/?img_index=1). I'll unravel it when the test is done and make myself a big green hat and snood, and I'll make a Meadow Scarf in the actual correct yarn weight this winter.

-   J and I booked our honeymoon to Thailand! We got a really good deal via Jack's Flight Club. We don't really know what we'll be doing there yet, but we're _definitely_ visiting [Elephant Nature Park](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/enp/visit-volunteer) in Chiang Mai. They are one of a few ethical elephant sanctuaries in the country. They rescue elephants from terrible situations and show them a good time for the rest of their lives. Visitors aren't allowed to interact directly with the elephants apart from one or two who are friendly and might come and say hi of their own accord. Riding and bathing the elephants is banned. The sanctuary is also home to hundreds of rescue dogs and and cats. They will have to crowbar my hands off the doorframe to get me to leave.
