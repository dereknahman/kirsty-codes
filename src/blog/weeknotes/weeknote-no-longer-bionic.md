-   Had the Nexplanon taken out on Wednesday last week and I already feel back to normal. The anxiety was grinding and unrelenting and I just could not take it any more. They sent me away with a Nuvaring which has remained in the drawer and it will expire there. My time on hormonal contraceptives has ended for good. It's a bit of a shame because using them helps with menorrhagia but I've accepted that that pathway is closed to me. I am on day 12 of my current period and I'm being a champ about it.

-   Went to my first Iyengar class yesterday hoping to be wrung out like a wet tea towel and I was. Massively enjoyable. I wish I could go to that particular class again but it's smack in the middle of the workday so I'll have to reserve it as a bank holiday treat.

-   I've been going to small group personal training sessions down the road from where I live. It's in a soundproofed room off to the side of a busy gym and there's a maximum of six people in each class which means I can put my fear of earning myself an injury through inexperience to one side and really enjoy the experience. And it is enjoyable! This continues to be a surprise. I reverse lunged half of my bodyweight this morning which is a milestone for me, and I especially like bike sprints.

-   In crafting project news, I've decided to become a shawl knitter. I'm working on some time consuming but very simple projects at the moment and I am DYING to do something more challenging, so I chose the [Sylphe shawl by Natasja Hornby](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sylphe-2) (who is just casually the most beautiful woman in the world alongside being an impressive and prolific designer). I chose [this GORGEOUS shade of violet](https://www.dererumnatura.fr/en/yarns/60-ulysse-336.html#/couleur-clematite). I love a really punchy colour, but I tend to hate most shades of purple. They're for the most part very dreary, but this one has an electric quality that plays so nicely with the heathered wool. I made J a jumper out of a De Rerum Natura wool a year ago and it still looks as lovely as the day it was finished, so I feel confident that I'm onto a winner here.

-   My knitting plans for this year are: finish self-drafted design for J, finish my wedding cardigan, put sleeves on my Esther Sweater, start the lovely shawl I just mentioned, knit sister-in-law-to-be something currently unspecified, finish the little pig toy I started last year, start baby blanket, finish the all-over cable cardigan I've been working on for a year on-and-off.

-   We went to the [Enzo Mari exhibition](https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/enzo-mari) at the weekend. Hugely inspiring and I recommend you go so you can look at the wonderful stories and puzzles and furniture.

-   My pal I has finished riso printing our wedding invitations and they look so incredible. I feel quite tearful thinking about it. Friends sharing their talents with you ðŸ˜­ðŸ’š
