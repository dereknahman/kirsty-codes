-   This week has been good. My mental health has continued to even out post-Nexplanon and I didn't feel as if I was hanging by my last remaining thread even once.

-   I have only one sleeve to go on my first self-drafted pattern (a jumper for J in the most beautiful wool). I celebrated this milestone by casting on another project. sadtrombone.wav. I really must cast the second one on soon because it deserves a good airing before being packed away for the summer.

-   Saw Lisa Eldridge on the street for the second time and managed to hold in a loud declaration of love for the second time.

-   We've started a trialling some software at work, and I am coordinating quite a bit of the trial. This has involved dusting off some long dormant project management skills from my bid management past, though thankfully my colleagues now have a much more collaborative spirit than they did in those days which makes everything simpler.

-   I can now knit colourwork using the intarsia technique thanks to the wonderful [Wendy Peterson](https://www.instagram.com/yarnsub/) of [YarnSub](https://yarnsub.com/). I went along to a workshop hosted by [Wild and Woolly](https://www.wildandwoollyshop.co.uk/), which is my favourite knitting supply shop in London, not least because I always seem to go along when another of their customers, a baker at the Savoy, has just dropped off loads of delicious cake. This weekend I'll finish the swatch I began in the class and block it and add it to my monster bag of swatches that I plan to make a big horrible blanket out of one day.

-   We went along to a small gathering for J's dad's birthday on Sunday. It was lovely and we left with a borrowed collection of Saul Steinberg illustrations. On the way home we just missed a train and it was going to be 20 minutes until the next one, which made me antsy, so I instead suggested an hour-and-a-half's walk home to save us waiting for 20 minutes. This feels sensible to me but probably doesn't read as such. I do it all the time. We spent some time pointing out our favourite weird little Saul Steinberg figures before bed.
