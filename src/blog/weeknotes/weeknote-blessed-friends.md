-   Work has been busy but it's starting to feel as if we might be getting somewhere on planning a big project. We just have to start it now...

-   I know someone who is very good at riso printing who has made an incredibly kind offer to print up our wedding invites. I feel very lucky to have such helpful and talented friends.

-   The episode of [You're Wrong About on George Michael](https://open.spotify.com/show/1RefFgQB4Lrl7qczcTWA3o) made me fall deeper in love with him as a person, and I've been a fan since I got a tiny purple CD and tape player for Christmas 1996 with the Wham! Greatest Hits CD inside it.

-   Nexplanon has been playing me like a fiddle. I'm on my second period of the month. Feel a bit weird and uncomfortable and emotional. I'm back on my daily mood diary and the moment the symptoms start to get in the way of my life, that thing is coming out of my arm. I spent a lot of Sunday in pain on the sofa which wasn't delightful and I'm unwilling to do much more of that with the stress of added hormones. My body is very good at elaborate periods and horrible cramps on its own.

-   I've managed to keep up exercising at higher intensity. I'm doing two strength training sessions and around four or five reformer pilates sessions per week. My posture has improved a lot and my brain whispers "east west collarbones!" to me periodically which has helped me keep out of the smashed croissant shape I seem to find myself in when I sit at my desk. I will never again live in a place with such easy (and subsidised!) access to bougie exercise spots so I'm really going for it while it lasts.

-   We are planning our Thailand itinerary. We'll be there for two weeks. Everyone on Reddit says you shouldn't do north and south, and instead just pick one, but we are of course planning to do north and south. We're thinking a day or two in Bangkok, straight up to Chiang Mai on the sleeper train for six or seven days (maybe with a lateral trip to Pai?) and then the sleeper train back down to Bangkok and transport to Koh Kood, then back to Bangkok for the flight home. Ah. That does sound like a lot of travel now I've typed it all out.
