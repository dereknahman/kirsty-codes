Happy autism awareness month!

I have mentioned being autistic on social media occasionally since my diagnosis last year but I always feel uncomfortable doing so, and often I delete the relevant post within a few hours. I think part of it is that I don’t feel “autistic enough”, and that I’ve had some weird feedback from people I know that I don’t “seem autistic” (which I now recognise as the most cliched response to someone, especially a woman, being diagnosed autistic late in life, but it left a mark on me).

What I do know is that I really struggle socially, I mask by default to the point I struggle with knowing who I am and _being_ who I am around others, I don’t really like being around people for all that long, holidays stress me out, I am shit to the point of perceived malevolence when it comes to maintaining friendships, knitting is my special interest (another late-diagnosed autistic woman cliche) and I seem to be locked in an eternal struggle to access the implied meaning in what people say to me.

Given that there is no such thing as an autistic behaviour or feeling (and by this I mean there isn’t a single behaviour or feeling that belongs solely to autism or autistic people) it is pointless putting together definitive lists of what helps autistic people. We are all different. I am going to share some tips for things that, selfishly, either have helped or would help me at work, in the hope they might bring you a bit closer to what works for you or your neurodivergent colleagues.

### A vague invitation is no invitation at all

A common response from supportive managers and colleagues is “let us know if you need any support” after they learn that someone is, for example, autistic. This is a lovely thing to say and shows that they care and want to be helpful. But what if the neurodivergent person doesn’t know what support is on offer? Perhaps they’ve recently been diagnosed with a neurodiverse condition and actually have no idea what might feasibly help them beyond the usual to-do apps and many thousands of Post-It notes they’ve been living on for the past few decades.

In this scenario it’s useful to extend specific offers to people who, for example, may have recently told you they’ve been diagnosed with a neurodiverse condition. Here are some suggestions.

-   If you are their manager, share 360 review feedback with them ahead of any in-person discussions about it to give them time to process it alone.
-   Ask them if they’re aware of tools they could use to alleviate stress around meetings (such as the new note-taking tool in Gemini for any FT colleagues - hi pals). If they aren’t, show them how to use it, or direct them to someone who can.
-   Support them with home-working if they find in-person working difficult, or delve deeper into their specific needs to see if you can adjust the office environment to be less overwhelming to them if that is the person’s choice.
-   Offer to do a calendar audit with them to check which meetings are essential for them to attend and which are skippable. This may not be as obvious as you think!

### Be thorough in your Jira tickets

I’ll speak from my own experience here because that is the only experience I am an expert on: I hate rubbish Jira tickets. I think everyone does, but I really hate them. If the work isn’t appropriately broken down, with a clear goal and scope, acceptance criteria, and it hasn’t been placed in some order in relation to its immediate context, the ramp-up phase for me getting into the work is significantly longer and harder. This makes work more stressful, and can lead to a feeling of “going blank” and being unable to engage.

### Deadlines are lifelines

If work has no deadline, my motivation to engage with it is pretty much nil. Deadlines can be strict or speculative, but there must be a deadline. If there is no deadline then I could feasibly submit the work whenever I want, and we may have very different ideas of what a reasonable timeline is, so it’s best to choose a deadline and communicate it clearly so that we all get what we need.

### Support them in not attending team socialising days or trips to the pub

When I started my current job I went to the pub with colleagues a few times. I wanted to be a different to how I had been in the past (quiet, awkward, or manic and awkward), casually skip to the pub and have an enjoyable time with a group of new people and slowly bed into my new role, making friends along the way. What happened is I got so overwhelmed by the sound, light and people I drank too much so that I could handle it and ended up bawling my eyes out on the long train home before landing in an exhausted heap on the sofa unable to speak. I have been on a group work socialising trip _once_ since. I’ve been in this job for three years now.

I must restate that not every autistic person experiences group work socialising like this, but I do, and from my social circle I can say that I am not the only one.

If your autistic colleague or report has a tendency to not show up to these things, try to see it as an act of self-care on their part, rather than a sign of obstinacy or contempt. Continue to extend the invites (unless you are asked not to), but please make it very clear the event is not mandatory and there is no professional penalty for not coming along, and see to it that that’s the case.

### "Cameras on please!" and other horror stories

When I am struggling to concentrate in meetings I turn my camera off and walk around my office, which is also my living room, in circles with my noise canceling headphones on. Sometimes I knit so I can focus my kinetic energy somewhere and consequently actually listen to the words being spoken rather than have them simply wash over me. Sometimes I adjust my standing desk up-down-up-down and rock backwards and forwards in my chair for the same reasons. None of these things visually transmit “I am working hard to listen to what people in this meeting are saying” to my fellow meeting attendees, so I turn my camera off to get on with them in private.

If I have my camera on I spend significantly more time looking at myself to make sure I'm pulling the "right" face than I do listening to anyone else.

It is important that neurodivergent people feel they can use the coping strategies they have developed to manage their time at work. Support them in doing so, and please hold in any “cameras on!” requests unless the success of that meaning literally relies on you seeing their moving human face.

### That's all for now!

I hope this helped someone out there.
