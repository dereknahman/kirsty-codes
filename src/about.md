I started my career as a full-stack developer in 2019 via a bootcamp while living in my favourite city, Berlin. Now I work at the Financial Times in London, where I'm from, having spent some time working at a vet tech start-up and, after that, an agency that works primarily with third-sector clients.

My biggest interests in the web development space are HTML, CSS and accessibility. This website exists because I wanted a space to tinker with all those things outside of work.

Having spent the vast majority of the pandemic trying to pull off a pretty drastic career transition, these days you can most often find me crafting in the evenings and weekends. I fell back in love with knitting a year ago, and I love being back in hobby-driven spaces on the web where people share tips, tricks and knowledge. [Here's a link to my Ravelry profile](https://www.ravelry.com/people/torahwilcox) if you like this sort of thing too.

### Things I've done

[I was on a podcast](https://aquestionofcode.com/68-are-bootcamps-worth-doing-kirsty-simmonds/) with the charming lads from A Question of Code, admittedly quite a while ago now. This episode is about my experience of changing career via a bootcamp.

[I wrote an article for Smashing Magazine on how to structure your independent learning](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/building-personal-learning-curriculum/). I was talking about my experience of learning new things as a dev, but the advice I give can be applied to pretty much anything to do with structuring your studies.
