I started my career as a full-stack developer in 2019 via a bootcamp while living in my favourite city, Berlin. Now I work at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/) in London, where I'm from. Before that I had countless other jobs doing stuff that had nothing to do with programming.

## Stuff I've done

[I was on a podcast](https://aquestionofcode.com/68-are-bootcamps-worth-doing-kirsty-simmonds/) with the charming lads from A Question of Code, admittedly quite a while ago now. This episode is about my experience of changing career via a bootcamp.

[I wrote an article for Smashing Magazine on how to structure your independent learning](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/building-personal-learning-curriculum/). I was talking about my experience of learning new things as a dev, but the advice I give can be applied to pretty much anything.
