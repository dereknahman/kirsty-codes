### Stuff I've done (a while ago now)

[I was on a podcast](https://aquestionofcode.com/68-are-bootcamps-worth-doing-kirsty-simmonds/) with the charming lads from A Question of Code, admittedly quite a while ago now. This episode is about my experience of changing career via a bootcamp.

[I wrote an article for Smashing Magazine on how to structure your independent learning](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/building-personal-learning-curriculum/). I was talking about my experience of learning new things as a dev, but the advice I give can be applied to pretty much anything.

### About this site

This website is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a very convenient and powerful static site generator, and I'm using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) as a templating engine. Other than that it's just HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript.

I learned how to use 11ty using [Eleventy From Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/) when it was brand new. I think the content is a little out of date in some places, but it's still worth a look for getting a sense of how to organise things.

The fonts I've chosen, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee), are available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I deploy using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is somehow free and handles HTTPS for me. I trigger deploys by pushing my code to a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo.
