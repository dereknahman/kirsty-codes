### Personal websites I love

-   My partner Jonny designs beautiful book covers for a living. You can see his work [here](https://jpelham.co.uk/). He used to work in-house but now he's a freelance cover designer. He created his own website too!

-   Jan and I used to live in the same city but never met, though I would really like us to one of these days. His site is over [here](https://writing.jan.io/). He writes about the Berlin tech scene, his work as an engineer, and just things about what he thinks and where he's been.

### YouTube

-   My friend Martha once recommended [Dave Hurwitz's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DavesClassicalGuide) to me over coffee and I've been a firm fan ever since. He is just the funniest, warmest, most scathing, most knowledgeable person in classical music I can think of, and I keep up with his channel as much as I can.
