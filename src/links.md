### Personal websites I like

-   [My partner Jonny's website](https://jpelham.co.uk/) is where he records the beautiful book covers he designs for a living. He used to work in-house but now he's a freelance cover designer (mandatory plug: hire him!). He created his own website too, but scoffs when I call him a developer.

-   Sophie is one of the reasons my little site exists. After seeing [her incredible talk at FFConf 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGYm9VdfJ8s) I felt so inspired to create my own space on the web, far from the poisonous reach of arsehole multibillionaires, but it took me a while to get going and actually do it. [Her website is a joyous place](https://localghost.dev/).

-   My pal Nick cares about accessibility on the web a _lot_, and he shares a few of his thoughts on the subject on [his blog](https://nickcolley.co.uk/). He is also the reason [this digital remaster of UK government](https://design-of-forms.online/) forms exists on the web. He is _also_ the person who helped me to make the links on this site more descriptive so they are more useful to screenreader users. Thanks, Nick!

-   [Kara's website](https://ghost.computer/) is the exact colour of cherry drops. She actually makes synths! I don't understand anything about them but it is massively impressive and you should visit if you like music, because she makes that too.

-   Jan and I used to live in the same city but never met, though I would really like us to one of these days. [Jan's site](https://writing.jan.io/) is about the Berlin tech scene, his work as an engineer, and things about what he thinks and where he's been.

### YouTube channels

-   My friend Martha once recommended [Dave Hurwitz's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DavesClassicalGuide) to me over coffee and I've been a firm fan ever since. He is just the funniest, most scathing, most knowledgeable person in classical music I can think of.

-   [Fruity Knitting](https://www.youtube.com/@FruityKnitting) is run by Andrea Doig and her daughter Madeleine. The content is about knitting primarily but touches on social history, music, storytelling, travel, interviews with spinners and crofters, just all sorts.

-   [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile) is all about computers. They also have a sister channel, [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile), for the mathematicians. I really enjoy watching both, though I definitely think they could stand to seek out a few more people who aren't white men to talk to.

-   [Axia](https://www.youtube.com/@axiaasd2184/featured) is a group of diagnosticians who specialise in neurodiversity. I found out about [Sarah Hendrickx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKzWbDPisNk&t=3633s) after stumbling across their channel. Her talks about her life as a late-diagnosed autistic woman led to my own diagnosis at 33 last year. I'd recommend Axia's content to anyone who wants to learn more about neurodiversity, but especially to people who suspect they may be autistic. Their approach is genuinely person-first and they are very respectful with how they talk about and to autistic people.

-   [Hurfyd](https://www.youtube.com/@hurfyd) posts good electronic music. He made [a tool to download Bandcamp purchases in batches](https://github.com/hyphmongo/batchcamp) that my partner uses and enjoys.

### Blogs

-   I check in with knitwear designer [Ella Gordon's blog](https://ellagordondesigns.co.uk/) whenever I feel like looking at beautiful Shetland Fair Isle, which is pretty often these days. As well as designing beautiful colourwork garments and accessories, Ella also has an expansive collection of vintage Shetland knitwear which she talks about on her blog and her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ellagordondesigns/).

-   This is the website of a favourite architect of mine, [John Outram](http://www.johnoutram.com/). I grew up near the famous pumping station he designed on the Isle of Dogs and loved it from very early childhood. He is a true eccentric. I don't know of a living architect who writes about their own buildings the way he does. Read [his post about the pumping station I just mentioned](http://www.johnoutram.com/projectsmenu.html) to see what I mean.
